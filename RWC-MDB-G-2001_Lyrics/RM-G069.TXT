What Should I Tell Them?


What should I tell her? My six-year old daughter
How shall I teach her her prayers?
How can I tell her her daddy is leaving?
He's going to war over there.

How can I tell him? My ten-year old Johnny
What should I tell him to say?
Tell him to be strong? He's only a child
Though he grows up everyday.

Chorus

Oh why? Oh why? I can't understand
Why I would have to leave them?
Oh God, Dear God, Please answer my prayer
Until I can see them again

What should I tell her? My lovely wife Mary
Oh how could she ever know?
Now I must show her just how much I love her
That is the reason I must go

Repeat  Chorus

What should I tell them to say at my funeral?
If in the battle I fall
Tell them their father will always be with them
Tell them I loved them. That's all.

Tell them their father will always be with them
Tell them I loved them. That's all.
Tell them I loved them. That's all.
