RM-G027.TXT

Suddenly


Suddenly I get that funny feeling that I'm all alone
And then my heart goes reeling
Suddenly I just can't understand which way to go

Suddenly I wonder what is right and what is wrong for me
And I get lost in thinking
Then suddenly I wonder if there's anyone who really knows?

I need a little time to lighten up my mind you know
There's someplace that is calling me
Then I will find a dream, not as easy as it seems you know,
I need to grow.

Chorus

If you take your sweet time to understand the road your on, It's calling
Find your own road,
If you listen to your mind you'll hear it callin'
So open up your heart and find a place to start somewhere,
It's gonna take you there

Suddenly I need a little time to just sit down and say
"Will everything be OK?",
if I leave awhile or is it not my style to go away?

I never understand plans of every man today
Or am I missing something?
When will someone tell me why
I'm this kind of guy, I try, I don't know why.

Repeat Chorus
