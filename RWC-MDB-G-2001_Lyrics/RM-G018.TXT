Anything for Your Love


Just ask me anything,
You know I'd do anything for you girl
I'd buy you diamond rings
and I'd fly all around the world for you

Just tell me what to say.
You know I'd lie if you told me I had to
Each night I kneel and pray
I thank God for this love that is really true.

I'll do anything for you if you ask me
I'll make all your dreams come true
(Don't) put it past me

I will swim the roughest sea if you ask me
Climb a mountain or a tree
(Don't) put it past me baby, oh no,

Cause I am your man
Anything, I'll do it for you baby if I can

I'll be there for you everyday,
For this love you bring
I will do anything
