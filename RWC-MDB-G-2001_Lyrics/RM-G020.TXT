Keep Running

Verse One

I just keep running from the crazy madness
I just keep running from the love that's burning me
I just keep running from the constant sadness
I just keep running from the world that's turning me

I just keep running like a long lost child
I just keep running just to set my heart at ease
I just keep running 'cause I'm wet and wild
I just keep running from the danger and disease

Repeat Verse one

I just keep running 'cause I'm going nowhere
I just keep running 'cause there's nowhere left to turn
I just keep running 'cause I'm broken and bare
I just keep running 'cause my heart's too cold to burn

1st rap
I keep running just to save my life
I keep running just to ease the strife
I'm not gonna be no poor man's wife
I gotta keep running just to save my life

2nd rap
I keep running just to find my home
I'm tired of being so lost and alone
Around the world I intend to roam
I'm like a lost dog lookin' for my bone! Yeah!
(ending..(Spoken) Keep running (repeat over and over)
