Tuesday Morning


There is a story I gotta tell ya,
It does not have a very happy ending
It all began in New York City
On a Tuesday morning-that started out pretty
There was a girl and her name was Mary,
Married to a man who's name was Jerry,
-They were living somewhere in Jersey,
I'm tellin' you- this is not heresay

It was a Tuesday just like any other,
Jerry was a good man, Just like any brother,
She made his lunch and she kissed him good-bye
He didn't even have a tear in his eye
He got on the train just like any other morning
Wasn't any news wasn't any kind of warning
He read the paper thinkin' of his wife
Didn't have a clue it was the end of his life

It would soon be over, no four leaf clover
Could save the man it had all began
Someone's sick old plan, no bomb in the van
So we didn't understand, It was sadder than sad
It was badder than bad, we went and lost a dream
That we didn't know we had, and it made it us cry
'cause we said good-bye to a beautiful sky
and we were left with the why? Why? Why? Why?





Tuesday Morning      Rap continued


So now there sayin' better not be mad
Turn the other cheek, and that bombing is bad,
It's all because of some policy
Well that's cool with me, but Hey what about Jerry?
Nobody asked him if it was OK
To go and take away his only life that day
Sometimes it seems we can do no right
They spit in your face but don't you dare ever fight

And all of you people who criticize
You better shut your mouth and open up your eyes
And say a little prayer for my good friend Jerry
and for Tuesday morning
without a bit of warning

Tuesday morning

(Oh it was) sadder than sad,
It was badder than bad
And I'm madder than mad
About Tuesday morning.

(Oh it was)sadder than sad,
It was badder than bad
And I'm madder than mad
About Tuesday morning.

(Oh it was) sadder than sad,
It was badder than bad
And I'm madder than mad
About Tuesday morning.

(Oh it was) sadder than sad,
It was badder than bad
And I'm madder than mad
About Tuesday morning.
