Desperate Little Man


Oh, John Hardy was a desperate little man
Strapped on his guns every day
Shot down a man on the West Virginia line
You ought to see John Hardy getting away
You ought to see John Hardy getting away

When he run up to Virginia around East Stone Bridge
Thought he would surely be free
And alone came a Marshall with a gun in his hand
Said Johnny come along with me
Johnny come along with me

Oh, John Hardy came to save a little woman
The dress she wore was blue
And she howled up to Johnny as he rode on out of town
Said Johnny, I'll be true to you
Johnny, I'll be true to you

I was let in to travel from the East to the West
From the North to the South in the town
But when the sun comes up tomorrow they'll take John Hardy down
And shone to his hanging ground
They'll gonna let John Hardy swing down

(Refrain Verse One)
