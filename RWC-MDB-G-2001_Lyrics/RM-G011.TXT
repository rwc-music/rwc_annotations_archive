21st Century


Can you hear 'em cryin'?
Can you see 'em dyin'?
All around the world
Politician's lyin'
Is anybody listenin'?
Will somebody lend a hand?
The century is dawning
Help us if you can

Chorus
Twenty-first century
Twenty-first century ,   Twenty-first century
How's it goin' for you?
Twenty first century,   Twenty-first century
Tell me are all your dreams comin' true?
Or are you feelin' black and blue?   Comin' true?
Or are they just usin' you?     I'm not gonna let em!

When I was a young girl
I was taught a million things
I could become president
That's what the future brings
But I'm a woman now
I lost the dream somehow
Now I just do the things that they tell me to do
Lonely and lost I feel
Somehow it's so unreal
Maybe I'll have to steal back my dreams
Is this what the future means?
Here I am
I don't give a hot damn!   Yeah!

21st Century     Continued

B part

I'm gonna show you all of the dreams of the 21st century
Some are gonna' hurt, This is what it means in the 21st century
Here we go,
Don't want no one here holdin' me
Steal the show,
Just let go till your soul is free

Instrumental

21st century,    21st century
Tell me are all your dreams comin' true?
(or) are you feelin' black and blue?
Comin' true?
Or are they using you?
I'm not gonna let em!

Ad libÅc..

No! No! No! No!
Take back your life in the 21st century!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
