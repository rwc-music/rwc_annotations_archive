Rocket in My Pocket


I have been looking for you
Someone who makes dreams come true
Baby, Hey, You're the reason my life is no longer blue,
When I look in your eyes, I feel like I'm in paradise
You are the reason I'm feeling grand, When you take my big strong hand,
I love all the good things about you, All the bad things about you
When I'm touching your body, I'm feeling such bliss,
I can't even understand this
Something here inside me, can't hide me, and you ride me, beside me, confide in me,
You taught me the meaning of pride

Instrumental

You, You, You, Oh you

I got something here in my pocket, You might thinkÅc it's a rocket
Well listen this rocket is hot for someone like you,
It's heatin' up down below,
I got to go where it can explode,
It is a load I carry it everyday,
There is no other way to explain it, I just gotta drain it.
Oh, When I'm looking at you,
I'm getting ready to do,
Hey you know who I'm talkin' too
This is all so totally true.
It's no lie, I'm not sayin'good-bye.
I would be shy, but why? I am not that kind of guy.
No one ever said this man was dry.

Oh I would be some kind of gent but you know me
I'll pay the rent, I'm not kind of guy who'd put you down
and then leave town
The world you know is filled with lies,
dirty alibi's, and guys with no prize,




Rocket in my PocketÅiRapÅj


Nice guys finish first! I thirst for you.
You know what I say is true,.

It's OK to say the things,
The things, the things, this lovin' brings,
Oh babe,
You know one day, I pray,
You'll say OK.  Oh babe, Oh babe,
Come on babe
Let's show em how the game of love is played.

Instrumental

I got a feeling you know
All of the words and the end of the show
I got a feeling that everything is gonna work out fine
Well you know all the guys
They won't give you a dime
They're involved in crime
They're no better than slime
Well they are not for you
Cause you are Miss Divine
I just need some time to show em Miss Divine is mine

Oh you, Oh you

Give me a chance just to show you them you are mine

Oh you,

Give me a chance to show that you're mine
You're mine,
Oh baby, give me time.
I believe that this is the time.
Let me show the world that you're mine.
I'm talkin' 'bout Miss Divine
You      Ad lib ending
