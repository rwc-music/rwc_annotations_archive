Get on up and Dance


Dancin' all night, with my baby,
And everybody's here, We're crazy,
Dancin' all night, getting' wasted,
And everybody's dancin'
We're dancin' to the rhythm of the night,
Romancin'
Dancin' to the rhythm of the night

(That's) right! We're dancin'
Dancin' to the rhythm of the night
Everybody get out on the floor
Get on up and dance
Get on up and dance
Get on up and dance

Dancin' all night, on the dance floor,
And everybody's got, what they ask for,
Party all night, Till the sun shines,
And everybody's dancin',

We're dancin' to the rhythm of the night,
Romancin',
Dancin' to the rhythm of the night,
(That's) right, We're dancin'
Dancin' to the rhythm of the night
Everybody get out on the floor
Get up and dance

And everyone let's dance!

Through the night with the light from above everybody

Let's dance!
Come on get down on the floor!
