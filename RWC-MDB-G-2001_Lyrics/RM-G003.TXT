In Your Arms

And in the morning, I wake,
Lying with your hand in mine
I never felt a morning like this morning, it breaks,
And I feel that life might be worth living now
'cause baby when I wake up

Chorus
In your arms,
I feel brand new
In your arms
It's paradise, your arms,
All my dreams have come true
And when I start a new day,

B Chorus
My dreams of love are comin' true now
I know that this time, I've found my love,
You will always be there,
I'm enraptured by all of your charms, your arms

And in the evening, I sleep,
Knowing that you're lyin' by me
And I know that you'll be there in the morning
I feel, that I found my angel of the morning
And my heart is warming when I'm

Chorus
B Chorus

Instrumental

Love is finally here, I celebrate love here in your arms
And I know in my heart that this time it's gonna stay
Here in your arms

B ChorusÅ~2
Ending Your arms, your arms, in your arms, in your arms
