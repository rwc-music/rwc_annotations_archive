Taking Your Heart


the girl was young
lived just outside his door
his heartbeat just a moment away
and he was young
he'd ask for nothing more
knew his love would ne'er fade away

and he'd say
I'll be there to comfort your mind
with a love that's so blind and true
and I'll be there with a love you can't find
a love you can't buy
so be true

and I'll  be
taking your love as I go
there's no turning back on this love that i know
and I'll be
taking your love as I go
I'll find any way to open up every door
so keep my heart till I take you away


so he was gone
off to the city with hope
his love for her a moment away
but he was young
he found it hard to cope
a need for another's touch was so real

and she'd say
I'll be there to comfort your mind
with a love that's so blind and true
and I'll be there with a love you can't find
a love you can't buy
so be true



*
and you'll be
taking taking my heart as you go
there's no turning back on this love that i know
and I'll be
taking taking my heart as you go
you hold the key to open up every door
so keep my heart till you take me away


and so she came
with hopes against hope
that she may see him again
but when she came
the man she knew of him was gone


and I'll be there to comfort your mind
with a love that's so blind and so true
and I'll be there with a love you can find
a love you can't buy
so be true
