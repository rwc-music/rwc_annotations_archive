It's Time to Fly


I found it's like a sunset going down
Now that our love has hit the ground
It's like a sunset going down, down, down,
On this summer's day, fading all away

It's like a photograph that's fading fast
Never meant to last, it is part of the past, our love

It's time to say our good-bye to love
Let's let it go now
As least we know that we tried to love
But now it's time to fly, say good-bye

Fly and try to reach the sky
It's time to try and look for a new day
It's time to fly and try to reach the sky
No need to cry for love that has died,
Love that is over

Just go, we don't need a show
In fact I do not know that reason why
Our love had to die, don't ask why 'cause it's time to fly

As least we know that we tried to love
Let's say good-bye now
And maybe one day we'll find someone
So we don't have to fly
Who knows why?

Fly and try to touch the sky
Just say good-bye to love that is over
It's time to fly and try to touch the sky
Please don't ask why.
There's no need to cry for love that is over

Repeat
