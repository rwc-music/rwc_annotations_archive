Lost in My Dreams


When you left me out of the blue, I broke down and cried
It was something I had to do, Let go of all of my pride

Now I see you, And I hear you, You're around me or so it seems,
I'm still with you, You're here with me, I get lost in my dreams

Chorus

Lost in my dreams,
You got me lost in my dreams
You said you'd stay with me forever
Lost in my dreams
You got me lost in my dreams
Lost in the dream of us together

When you walked right out of my life, You thought we were through,
Now that you're no longer my wife, I just can't get over you,
'Cause I remember, you made a promise,
You said you'd be there for better or worse.
You said you loved me, my heart was open,
And now I'm under your curse.

Chorus

You made a promise, and I believed you,
You said you'd love me for better or worse
My heart was open, and now it's broken,
You put me under your curse.

Chorus
