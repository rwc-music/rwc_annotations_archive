Secret Dreams


It was a Wednesday, I told you on a Wednesday.
Lost lover, lost friends day, One sad, lonely Wednesday
We fought on a Tuesday, That was our bad news day.
I told you, "Go away." You asked me if I'd stay,

Chorus

I said, "I wouldn't leave you but I've got secret dreams
That I've got tucked down inside here in my heart
They gotta come true and they will never come true
With a guy like you, It's true, sorry though it seems,
My secret dreams."

It was a Friday, We said our good-bye day,
You started to cry day, (could) not understand why day,

I said, "I wouldn't leave you but I've got secret dreams
That I've got tucked down inside here in my heart
They gotta come true and they will never come true
With a guy like you, it seems, all my secret dreams,

Dreams come true, I know it, Dreams come true,
Secret dreams are calling to me,
I've got a little secret
Dreams come true, I know it, Dreams come true,
I've got a little secret,
I can feel that they're comin' true now,
I can feel that they're comin' true now,
Secret dreams!

B part

"I wouldn't leave you but I've got secret dreams
That I've got tucked down inside here in my heart
They gotta come true and they will never come true
With a guy like you, it's true, Sorry Charlie,"

Dreams come true, I know it, Dreams come true,
Secret dreams are calling to me,
I've got a little secret
Dreams come true, I know it, Dreams come true,
I've got a little secret, I can feel that they're comin' true

Dreams come true, I know it, Dreams come true,
I can here 'em calling to me, I've got a little secret
Dreams come true, I know it, Dreams come true,
I've got a little secret, I can feel that they're comin' true lately,
I'm followin' all my secret dreams!
