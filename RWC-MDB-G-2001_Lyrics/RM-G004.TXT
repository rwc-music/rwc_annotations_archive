Hold On


And so our love is to be
The kind of love that lasts forever
And when you're here next to me
It's like I'm living a dream

After all of these years
We spent oh togather
Nothing takes the moments away

All the things that move with time
Is always on my mind
You are all that I  know
And I  never wanna let go

*
Hold on to the day
Hold on to the end of time
We can fall in love over again
Someday somewhere
When we look back at ourselves
I  know we'll be togather
You and I


Do you remember the day
Do you remember the feeling
Oh when you wrap your arms around me
When you say that you care

I was so afraid of a lonely tomorrow
Heartache was the only thing I had

But then you came along
And sorrow was no more
You are all that I know
And I never wanna let go

*

You never ask things you wonder
You just wait until you wonder no more
And I  know  I have to think no more

Gotta feeling we'll make it
Longer, a fine, ever-lasting love
Tell me you know you feel it too
Say that you will be mine
From now till the end of time
