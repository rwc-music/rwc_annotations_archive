Woman


I hear it calling. It is a voice that's ringing here in my mind
It's says to listen, Listen to the voice that's singing there in your heart
It is a voice that's calling, "I'll be there to stand by you babe, I'll be there"
Just listen to me, Listen close to the voice that is there in your heart

Chorus

Woman, 'cause you were born to be free, So free
Just like a bird in the sky
Woman, 'cause there's a time you must listen just to be,
Trust in your heart and your heart will set you free

You'll hear it calling. There is a goddess that is calling to you
You'd better listen, Listen to the voodoo that you're doing so well
It is your soul that's calling, "I'll be there to stand by you babe, I'll be there"
Just listen to me, Listen close to the voice that is there in your heart

Chorus

Because the goddess of love's callin' you "I'll be there"
And you know that she cares
She is there within all your wildest dreams and dares

Chorus

'cause you were born to be beautiful and free

Woman, ' cause you were born to be free, So free,
Woman Åc
