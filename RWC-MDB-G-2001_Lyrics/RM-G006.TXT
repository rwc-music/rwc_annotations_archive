Let's Take Some Time Åc To Think It Over


Why do people have to fall right away in love?
Would be better if we took a little time
Why do people have to tell you good-bye in love?
Can't understand about love

 A Chorus

Although we're saying our good-byes now
One dream was shared by two, now it's over
We didn't even really try now
And I know in my heart now,

B  Chorus

Our love in so brand new
We should take some time to think it over now
This love is worth the time
Let's take some time to think it over

If you want me just to walk out that door I will
But I know that you'll be so sorry someday
If you want me just to go for a while I will
Oh in my heart babe I know

CHORUS  (A and B)

Our love is so brand new

Repeat B Chorus
