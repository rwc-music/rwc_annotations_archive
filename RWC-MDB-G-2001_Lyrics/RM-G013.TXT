Guess Again


I know what you're talkin' bout baby
I've heard all of that jive before
You're telling me, You're movin' in, Oh honey, You ain't listnin'

You think I'm in love with you baby
You think you're God's gift to the kingdom
You better go, I mean it, Are you listnin'?

You want me to pay for your din din
You think I should take you to London?
Guess again, better guess again

Chorus
I'm comin' up. I got a life now
I want someone who really needs me
Guess again, guess again
I'm not cleanin' up no more
I got a job. I'm going somewhere
I don't need you hangin' around here
Guess again, better guess again
I'm movin' on and you're movin' out!

There once was a time a way back
When I used to jump for you
Those days are gone, It's all wrong, Hey baby, Are you listnin'?

I'm not just your little old fool now
I guess I learned something in school now
Guess again, better guess again

I paid your last phone bill now
And I'm never gonna pay one again now
Guess again, oh honey, guess again

I called up the police station,
And I told them you're in town, Yo,
Guess again, better guess again

Chorus

Instrumental

You think you can walk back in here
And you think I'll welcome you Mister
Number one, all done, Are you listnin'?
You're a no good mother
I tell you you're a no good lover
Don't want no more
There's the door, Show me what it's used for!

If you are a thinkin' bout callin'
Your little friends, one of your homeboys,
Guess again, honey, Are you listnin?

I've already done that baby
There's a posse lookin' for you now,
Guess again better guess again

Chorus
