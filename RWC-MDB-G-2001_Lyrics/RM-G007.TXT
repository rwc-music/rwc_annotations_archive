Everyday Lovin'


It was a Monday night and I was thinkin' 'bout you
It was Tuesday moon. I couldn't sleep without you
It was a Wednesday, Thursday, and a Friday too
It was a Saturday I fell in love with you
It was a Sunday when you said you loved me

Chorus

I guess I think about you everyday
First in the morning, later when I close my eyes
I got a feeling that you're gonna stay
My Daddies warning, Momma thinks you're mighty nice
I guess I think about you all the time
My heart is shakin' when I'm standing by your side
I got this feeling that is so sublime
I'm not mistaken, baby when I look in your eyes I'm in paradise

It was a summer day when you came walkin' by me
It was an autumn night when I first let you try me Ooh!
It was a winter's day when I was holdin' you
It was the first of May when all my dreams came true
There's not a season (or) reason not to love you

Chorus

Chorus  (Repeat first four lines of Chorus twice)

I guess the time has come for you to ask for my hand
It's gonna be such fun,  just what I had planned
I'm gonna be your girl and you'll be my man
I heard it long ago, This is how it all began
