Feeling the Hate


You know I'm feeling the hate
You know I'm feeling the pain
I want you out of my life
Don't you stick around me

You know I'm feeling the hate
You know I'm feeling the pain
I want you out of my life
Don't want you around me

Hate- It is a word I cannot take
Hate- It is a force we have to break

You know I'm feeling the hate
You know I'm feeling the pain
I want you out of my life
Don't you stick around me

You know I'm feeling the hate
You know I'm feeling the pain
I want you out of my life
Don't want it around me

Hate- it is a word that makes hearts break
Hate- It is a feeling I can't take

I can feel it all around me
I can feel it in your soul
I can feel it hanging on me
I'm about to lose control of hate!

I don't want any around me
I don't want any around me
I don't want any around me
I don't want any around me

HATE!           (Repeat from beginning)
