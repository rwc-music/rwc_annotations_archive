Wasting Time


Woke up today to the love I had lost
I wasn't sure but I had to go on
Can't keep pretending that I  know its there
Can't keep pretending till I find a reason

There ain't no rights or wrongs about it
I feel it in my heart
If I can write two songs about it
It'd be true
I've been wasting my time
On a love that's just not there
On a love you could not care so

*
Stop wasting your time
Start looking for tomorrow
Stop wasting your time
Oh baby we could work it out
You know this doesn't have to be good-bye


If there's a chance to ever go back in time
I'd find a way to try to keep you besides me
I try pretending that I really don't care
I keep preteinding that there is a reason

If only I could find a way
I know it in my heart
I can't stand just to see you walk away
It'd be true
I've been wasting my time
On a love that's just not there
On a love you clould not care so

I meant to say in time baby we could work it out
I never meant to say good-bye
