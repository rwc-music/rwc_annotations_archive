Trustin' in Your Groove


When you feel like dancin'
When you feel a little bit funky
When you start romancin'
And your minds a little bit junky

Listen to the rhythm, Feel it in your body,
Let it take control and keep your mind wide open now
Listen to the rhythm, Feel it in your body
Feel it in your soul and keep you heart right open now

Come on and just let go of all the shame you been feeling
I know your temperature is up. Just trustin' in your groove!

Out there on the dance floor, everybody's watching your body
Let it get all funky, Take it off and show what you got babe
Don't you care what they say, Don't you care what they do
Only thing to care about is feeling funky now

All they want is your love, and your sexy body,
Movin' to the rhythm of the funky factory!

Come on and just let go of all the pain you've been feeling
It's time to get into the act. Just trustin' in your groove!

Come on and just let go of all the pain you've been feeling
It's time to get into the act. Just trustin' in your groove!

When your feeling sexy
And you feel a little bit funky
Come and move your body
Shake it till it gets hot and hunky

When your feeling funky
When you feel a little bit nasty
You can have my body
You can take a bite if you ask me.         (Repeat )
