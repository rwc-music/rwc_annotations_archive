RM-G002.TXT

Forget about It


So you're running on borrowed time
Trying to find the limelight
Sitting on the inside looking out
And what you see you do not like
Everything's gone, just moved on

And in your head do you feel
What you are not supposed to feel
Take away the good times
and then you are left with destitute

Waiting for someone to end the story
but you know in your mind

*
The world comes crashing down
All around
It's a game that you can't win
not even a major sin
Throw it in the trash bin
The sky comes crashing down
and down
It's a game that you can't win
not even a major sin
Throw it in the trash bin
just forget abut it


You're just waiting for another day
trying to find a new way
Searching for the words to say
Just reaching out
Trying to get your feet back on the ground
Everything's gone, you move on

Nerver thought you'd be the one to say it in the end
Never thought your story would have
such an unhappy ending
Never thought you'd have to tell the story at all
But you know

*
