Where Are You?


ÅñWhere  I  am
 Where  you  are
 Where  we  are
 Last  night  you  were  gone  away  from  my  hands

  Who  I  am
  Who  you  are
  I  miss  you  tonight
  You  are  faraway  from  my  side

    Remember  the  words  I  sent  to  you
    Remember  my  heart  beating  for  your  love
    I  gave  you  anything  I  could  for  you
    But  now  you're  walkin'  the  other  side

Åñ Refrain


    So  many  times  passed  by  you  and  I
    So  many  tears  ran  down  between  us
    I  just  can't  see  the  true  in  your  heart
    'Cause  now  you're  walkin'  the  other  side

Åñ Refrain

  Where  are  you  now ?  Å~ÇU
