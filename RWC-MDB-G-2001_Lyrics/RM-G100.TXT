Precious Love


I've been searching for someone
For a long long time
It seemed so hard that I had the light
Even a ray of light

But I'm aware of you're closer now
Somehow very close to me
You never make me blue, so I got the truth
I need nothing else

Don't have to be afraid
Even in the dark
And I could find myself
'Cause I can be with you

ÅñYou are the only one who can give me precious love
 Though things don't go easily
 We'll go where we wanna go

Don't have to stay
In the pretended world
And I proud of myself
'Cause I can be with you

Åñrepeat

Nothing else, there's no bothering us
No longer, forever
Could you give me softly smile, babe?
That is all I want

That is all I want
