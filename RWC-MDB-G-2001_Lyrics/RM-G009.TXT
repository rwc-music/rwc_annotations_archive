Waiting for Your Love


Well I could never forgive you, You couldn't forgive me
You couldn't show all you feelings, I couldn't see
Well there were rules that were controlling us that we couldn't see
Rules that killed that love of you and me.

Well now I'm standing in the dark all on my own
And I am thinking 'bout the love we could have known
And I will always be hanging on to my dream
Dreaming of the love of you and me everyday

I know if you'd open you heart we could find,
find the dream of love we've been waiting for,
If you'd open your heart to me I will stay in your heart forever,
In your heart forever.

If you could only believe in me and I'd believe in you
If you could open your heart again, it's so true
But in these busy and these crazy times love is hard to find
Why don't you just believe in mine?

Cause I am holding on to you down in my soul
And I am waiting for your heart to take control
And I will always be hanging on to my dream
Dreaming of the love of you and me everyday
I know if you'd open your heart we could find,
Find the dream of love we've been longing for
If you'd open your heart, I'm waiting here
I'm waiting here for your love
I'm waiting here for your love

Instrumental

If you open your heart you will find that I'm here
I'm always waiting for your love
If you open your heart, I'm waiting for you
Come and make my dreams true.
If you open your heart you will find that I'm here
I'm always waiting for your love
I'll be waiting for you forever and then
Come into my heart again
Come into my heart again
