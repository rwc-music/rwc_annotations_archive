Living in a World of Destruction


Oh babe,
I need you everyday.  You're the reason that I'm feelin' this way
Without you, I'd be sufferin'
(Ridin' on) the rhythm of pleasure and pain
You're my sunshine, You're my darlin' baby
You're my moonshine, Girl you drive me crazy
You're my darkness, You're my desperation

Chorus
You're my reason to be living in a world of destruction
You're my savior and light
Yes we are living in a world of destruction
 Shine your light on my dark night.

I need you like a drug, I just got to take you everyday
Without you, I'd lose everything,
(I'll do anything) to make you stay
'Cause I crave you, in the early morning,
(I'm a slave for you) better heed the warning,
If you leave me, I will die tomorrow

Chorus       Instrumental

I need you really bad, (You're the best lovin') that I've ever had
Without you, I'd be all alone
(Like a lost soul) with no house or home
'Cause I need you, you're my buried treasure
(I would bleed for you) tear my heart with pleasure
If I lost you, I would cry forever.
Repeat ChorusÅ~2 (2nd time change first line)
    Yes, we are living in a world of Destruction..
      Last lyrics- Shine your light
