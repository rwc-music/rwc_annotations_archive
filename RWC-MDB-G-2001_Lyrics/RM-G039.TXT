Jullia

Kind  of  nice  for  you  to  stop  by
I've  just  come  back  from  some  of  arren  at  mine
Won't  you  come  on  in  and  have  a  little  chat  about  you  and  I
Don't  make  me  blush  with  that  lookin'  your  eyes

Hold  my  hand  and  whisper  in  my  ear
Sing  me  a  song,  song  you've  always  sung  for  me
Go  out  to  the  balcony  and  set  some  flowers  you've  sent  for  me
Sit  and  wait
" Which  would  you  like,  pasta  or  soup ? "

Never  made  such  thing  so  good
I  don't  know  if  you  like  it  or  not

Have  you  noticed  that  I  cut  my  hair ?
Wanted  to  make  me  look  like  Jullia
Got  my  bangs  kind  of  too  short
But  hope  you  like  the  way  I  look
Everyday  I'm  thinking  of  you


Well, the  sun  has  finally  gone  down
Let's  go, Åiwe're  not  set  some  fur  you  tonight Åj

Wait,  don't  go,  it's  not  over  yet
Still  haven't  talked  what  we'll  do  next  weekend
Why  don't  we  go  on  a  picnic  over  there  up  on  the  hill ?
What  do  you  think ?
You  can  bring  your  dogs

Oh,  stay  a  little  longer
