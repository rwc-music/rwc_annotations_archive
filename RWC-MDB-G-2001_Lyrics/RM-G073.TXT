Not Enough Words


You  and  I  never  been  so  happy  in  our  life
We've  got  everything  what  we  need  in  our  hands

Sun  shining  day,  children're  running  around
Birds,  they  are  singing
Makes  my  heart  full  of  joy,  yeah


  ÅñNot  enough  words  to  tell  you
   What's  kind  of  place  this  world  could  be
   You're  sitting  next  to  me  with  smile
   I  thank  god  that  I'm  alive
   When  we  all  believe  the  strength  in  our  hearts


Have  we  forgotten ?
For  so  long  we  have  shared  our  tears
Don't  we  all  think  that  it's  our  time  to  make  a  change,  yeah


ÅñRefrainÅ~ÇQ
the  strength  in  our  hearts
