Dream Angel


Like a dream, strong and free,
You're the angel calling me,

Chorus

In the spring I will sing of the magic that you bring
In the summer my love, stars will shine from you from above,
In the autumn you'll call, as the leaves all start to fall,
In the winter my dear, like an angel you'll appear.

B Part

In the wind you are calling me
In summer you set me free
In the starlight I see you name
I know you'll be back again

In the winter when snowflakes fall
I'll answer your beckon call
I'll be there by the frozen sea
I know you'll be back for me

Repeat Chorus

(Last line)  I sing.
