Tonight's the Night for Love


Tonight's the night for love
I'm gonna open my heart for you
I'm in the mood for love
I'm gonna go where this love takes me

Tonight's the night for love
I'm gonna get in the groove for you
I'm in the mood for love
I'm gonna make your dreams come true

Tonight's the night for love
I'm gonna dance with you all night long
I'm in the mood for love
I need a man who's big and strong

I saw you when you walked in tonight
And I knew you were comin' home with me
Just one look and the feelings so right
Oh tonight is the night

I've been waitin' here through the night
For a man who's totally sexy
I got nothing to do tonight
And it looks like your watchin' my body

I've been waitin' for all my life
For a man who totally needs me
I can see it there in your eyes
You're a man who is setting my heart free

(Optional whisper)
Tonight's the night for love
I'm gonna dance with you all night long
I'm in the mood for love
I need a man who's big and strong
