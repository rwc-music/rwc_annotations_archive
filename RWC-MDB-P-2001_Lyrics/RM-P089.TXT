Life Is What You Make It To Be


If you like fun, let's go out 
We can let our hair down and clown about 
What's the use of sitting home
We should all be having fun
You like to sing, let's go out
We can dance and scream and shout
What's the use of being alone

 *	Life can be fun come and try
  Have a laugh please don't cry
  Come on come on come on come on
  Let's all have some fun

Shout it once Shout it twice
Let's all celebrate our life!
Come on now let's all play
The game of life
Come on now just live your dream
Spend your days with a smile
Yes if you like fun just live your life
