Don't Say Good bye


If you go back in time
To a place in your mind, like a clear view
I gave you my word that I would never leave you

Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret but believe me
It breaks my heart to see you crying

I don't want to lose yo baby
I could never make it alone
After all these years, oh maybe
A bit of misunderstanding has sneaked into our lives

 ÅñDon't you never ever say goodbye
  Don't tell me that's the thing that's on your mind
  We both know we are made for each other
  So don't leave me behind

  So don't you ever say goodbye
  Don't tell me that's the thing that's on your mind
  So until I find a way to rid this pain
  Don't say goodbye

From the night we first met
Your smile's been the meaning of my life
With just a glance I knew you were mine

I was all alone in the night
And it was you who gave me the light
Let me hold you, oh so tight
Don't let a bit of misunderstanding come in between us

  Åñrepeat 
  Say  goodbye

But the world must carry on
We believed our love could be so strong
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Its time we carried on?

  Åñrepeat 
  Don't say goodbye
  Don't say goodbye
  Don't say goodbye
