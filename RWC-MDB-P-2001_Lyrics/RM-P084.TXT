Someday


So the world's come tumbling down
Not a one thing I can do
And I don't know what I've done wrong
All I have are memories of you

Never had this pain before
Tears pouring down like rain
And now my heart just feels so sore
Don't believe I even had the power to fight the pain

 Åñ(one night) 
  Was it a moment of passion
  (one light) 
  Or were you just playing with my emotion
  (what's right?)
  There's nothing I could do or say to change the ways things might have been
  (one night)
  There seems to be some confusion
  (one light)
  Gave you my love and my full devotion
  If only I could reach out to you somehow
  Someday


Do I look foolish running around
Searching for clues and reasons why
Yes, so my world's come crashing down
You got to find what's right and move along with the feeling

  Åñrepeat

When things get me down I feel a cry for passion
(seems that you're out of luck baby)
You thought I was sleeping at the wheels you may be right
(I think you got another think coming)


When the world comes tumbling down 
There's not a one thing you can do
You gotta find what's right or wrong and move along with the feeling

  Åñrepeat  
  Someday
  Someday
