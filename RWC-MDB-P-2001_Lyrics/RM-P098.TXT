31 BLUES


The sun is up on a brand new day
(I've) got to face the music	
I just can't stay
The winds of change are blowing me apart
And telling me to make a new start
Standing at the crossroads 	
(I) take a deep breath
Worrying about the future is scaring me to death
I say a prayer and take a step

*	I guess what everybody says is true about 31 blues
The time has come 	
I gotta pay my dues with 31 blues

The moon is out and I'm counting sheep
I toss and turn all night 		
I just can't sleep
Lifes little curveballs are driving me insane
I've got to keep my head in the game
Standing at the crossroads I hear a voice
Asking about tomorrow and where I'm going
I close my eyes and make my choice

* (Repeat)
