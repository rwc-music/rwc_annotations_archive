Change Of Heart

You can't imagine what I'm going through
You don't even notice when I call for you
You don't appreciate my love for you
Even though I need you now you're never there

When I first met  you I was so impressed 
With all your style and your sense of dress
But there is more to love than looks alone
I'm learning the hard way and I'm not a fool

*	Change of heart, change of mind over you
I'm turning away now 'cause you make me blue
Rainy days empty nights never to end
Since you broke my heart

**	I can remember such happy times we shared
When we were first in love
But times have changed you never show me love
And I've got start again

Why did your love go now was it something I did
That made you change the way you feel for me?
Now love has gone  and it can never return
But I need to know the reason why

* (Repeat)

Feeling low feeling sad over you
I can't remember when I felt so blue
I have to try to get back on my feet
I've got to start again

** (Repeat)

Feeling low feeling sad over you
I can't remember when I felt so blue

I've got to start again
