Waiting for the moment

She's more sweet than lollipops, brighter than sunshine !
Any given moment, She's got everything !
If I could be anything, I'd be her key-chain
So I could go anywhere she goes

Where is she now?
Where could she be ?
Everyday would be great if she were with me !

How do I tell her I want her so ?
When do I let my feelings show ?
I'm faithfully, so patiently
Waiting for the moment to let her know

How do I tell her I want her so ?
When do I let my feelings show ?
I'm faithfully, so patiently
Waiting for the moment to tell her so

What's  more sweet than chocolate ?
Fairer than starlight ?
Docter can you help me ? Love's infected me !
One thing I am sure of, I'm hers completely
She's in every single face I see

I need to learn, I've got to try
All of the magic known to make her mine !

How do I tell her I need her so ?
When do I let my feelings show ?
I'm carefully, so prayerfully
Waiting for the moment to let her know

How do I tell her I need her so ?
When do I let my feelings show ?
I'm carefully, so prayerfully
Waiting for the moment to tell her so

She's more sweet than lollipops, brighter than sunshine !
Just one look from her way takes my breath away !
If I had more confidence, more self assurance
I could say the words I want to say

But when she's near, or when she smiles
Everything in my brain is blank for

How do I tell her I love her so ?
When do I let my feelings show ?
I'm fervently, so nervously
Waiting for the moment to let her know

How do I tell her I love her so ?
When do I let my feelings show ?
I'm fervently, so nervously
Waiting for the moment to tell her so
