How Deep Is Your Love? 		

* 	Ooo I wanna kiss you 
  Loving you is my dream tonight
  Ooo hold me tenderly 
  Loving me with all your heart

Boy you never tell me that you love me
I'm going crazy wondering about you baby
Do you really know boy how much I care
Could you really show me how deep is your love?

Just close you eyes and hear my heart
The sweet, sweet beat of my love
Can't you tell I'm hungry baby
For only you can make me smile

* (Repeat)

Can't you understand me, my point of view
Do you really love me beyond all words
I just need to hear now from your sweet lips
I'm the only girl you ever want to kiss

Just close your eyes and hear my heart
The sweet, sweet beat of my love
Can't you tell I'm hungry baby
For only you can make me smile 

Instrumental

Just close your eyes and hear my heart
The sweet, sweet beat of my love
Can't you tell I'm hungry baby
For only you can make me smile 

* (Repeat)
