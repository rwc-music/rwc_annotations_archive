No Regrets


I loved you like no other
Giving all still yet with no regret
Every night and day
And like one after another
If I could go back I'd say anything
To make you stay

It seems wer're fighting for all of the wrong reasons
It's no use fighting and I just have to say
"I love you"


Oh in an instant was over
When eyes met eyes, no thought of demise
I knew you were the one
And long before we were lovers
Heart to fragments, fragments splintered
Into pieces, undone

I know you're talking about the rites of the season
I know you're talking but can't hear what you say
"I love you"


I love you more now that you're gone
I miss you more with emotions with drawn
Nothing untaken
Nothing lost
no regrets


Last night I dreamt of an angel
Who flew over me, and I saw beauty
As I watched her flight
And on me she cast a spell
Breathed the breath of life
In my body and then
Was gone again

I love in hope on finding that same old feeling 
My head keeps reeling I don't know what to say
"I love you"

I love you more now that you're gone
I miss you more with emotions with drawn
Nothing untaken
Nothing lost
no regrets


I love in hope on finding that same old feeling 
My head keeps reeling I don't know what to say
Maybe some words are best just left unspoken
Fighting it won't find the way


I love you more now that you're gone
I miss you more with emotions with drawn
I love you more now that you're gone
I miss you more with emotions with drawn
Nothing untaken
Everything's lost
no regrets
