Woman Like You


Just a glance in your innocent eyes
I was dazzled by light
You're my dream now, I know you are the one
Never thought in reality this day would come

I've been standing in a desperate line
Girl I want to make you mine
To mend the remains of a broken heart
Let me take your hand Let's make a start

 ÅñI want your love tonight
  Want to make it right
  If we believe, I know that nothing can stop us
  So hold on tight
  We can make it right
  I'll be right here
  I'll just be waiting for you
  For a woman like you


Down the road when I see your pretty face
I feel my heart begin to race
Once in a lifetime, oh maybe the last time
Whatever it is, oh girl, you put a spell on me

I've been standing in a desperate line
Girl I want to make you mine
To mend the remains of a broken heart
Let me take your hand Let's make a start

  ÅñRepeat
  For a woman like you
  For a woman like you
  You know I'll be there
  I'll be there


I've been standing in a desperate line
Girl I want to make you mine
To mend the remains of a broken heart
Let me take your hand Let's make a start


  I want your love tonight
  Want to make it right
  If we believe, I know that nothing can stop us
  So hold on tight
  We can make it right
  I've been waiting for a girl like you

  ÅñRepeat
  For a woman like you
