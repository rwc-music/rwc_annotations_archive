RM-P095.TXT

Feel

I've been waiting for a long long time
I need someone that'll touch my heart
Same old stories and the same old lines
I need to find a key that opens the lock

Take a chance (babe) 	Break the seal
Turn me on	Make me feel!

I've been jaded for a long long time
I need someone that'll reach my soul
(I) Crashed and burned 	squandered every dime
I gave it my all and got nothing to show

*	Rock on!		Set me free
 Rock on!		Eternally

Make it hotter than a burning sun
Take a chance (babe) 	Spin the world
Take me higher than I've ever gone
Turn me on 	Make me feel!

I've been raging for a long long time
I need someone that'll ease my pain
(The) way she played me was a crying shame
I wonder why I'd go through it again

* (Repeat)

Make it hotter than a burning sun
Take my heart 	It's a steal
Take me higher than I've ever gone
Turn me on	Make me feel!

I've been looking for a long long time
I need someone that'll change my life
(I'm) standing in mud and I'm panning for gold
If I don't get some	I think I'll explode

* (Repeat)  

Make it hotter than a burning sun
Light the fuse	Click your heals
Take me higher than I've ever gone
Turn me on	Make me feel!

I've been waiting for a long long time
I need someone that'll make it real
Same old stories and the same old lines
Woman I need you to make me feel
