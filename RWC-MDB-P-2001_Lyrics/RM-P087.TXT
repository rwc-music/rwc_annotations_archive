RM-P087.TXT

I think of you

I think of you 
In the Spring when gentle rains turn to showers
I think of you
When the Summer breezes dance through the flowers

And they whisper your name to me
And they bring back these memories
And I wonder how I ever lived before 
Without the love in my life that you bring me

*  You are the world to me
  You're all I see
  My love for you is more than a simple song
  It's a symphony, growing strong, yes, stronger over time
  You are the world to me
    You're all I see
    Your love means more than all the diamonds or gold that shines, 
  That man could find in a lifetime

I think of you
When the Autumn leaves are painted in color
I think of you
On those snowy Winter nights made for lovers

And it's not just the memories
You and I have a history
And I wonder how I ever made it through 
Without the light in my life that you bring me

* (Repeat)
