Jingle Bells

Dashing  through  the  snow, In  a  one  horse  open  sleigh !

O'er  the  fields  we  go, Laughing  all  the  way.

Bells  on  bobtail  ring, Making  spirits  bright.

What  fun  it  is  to  ride  and  sing  a  sleighing  song  tonight !

  Jingle  bells !  Jingle  bells !  Jingle  all  the  way !

  Oh, what  fun  it  is  to  ride, In  a  one  horse  open  sleigh !

  Jingle  bells !  Jingle  bells !  Jingle  all  the  way !

  Oh, what  fun  it  is  to  ride, In  a  one  horse  open  sleigh !


A  day  or  two  ago, I  thought  I'd  take  a  ride.

And  soon  Miss  Fannie  Bright  was  seated  by  my  side.

The  horse  was  hean  and  lank, misfortune  seemed  his  lot.

He  got  into  a  drifted  bank, and  we, we  got  upshot.

  Jingle  bells !  Jingle  bells !  Jingle  all  the  way !

  Oh, what  fun  it  is  to  ride, In  a  one  horse  open  sleigh !

  Jingle  bells !  Jingle  bells !  Jingle  all  the  way !

  Oh, what  fun  it  is  to  ride, In  a  one  horse  open  sleigh !
