Yankee Doodle

Yankee  Doodle  went  to  town,

A-riding  on  a  pony.

Stuck  a  feather  in  his  hat,

And  called  it  macaroni.

  Yankee  Doodle, keep  it  up, Yankee  Doodle  dandy,

  Mind  the  music  and  the  step  and  with  the  girls  be  handy.


Father  and  I  went  down  to  camp,

Along  with  Captain  Gooding.

And  there  we  saw  the  men  and  boys,

As  thick  as  hasty  pudding.

  Yankee  Doodle, keep  it  up, Yankee  Doodle  dandy,

  Mind  the  music  and  the  step, and  with  the  girls  be  handy.


There  was  Captain  Washington,

Upon  a  slapping  stallion

A-giving  orders  to  his  men.

I  guess  there was  a million

  Yankee  Doodle, keep  it  up, Yankee  Doodle  dandy,

  Mind  the  music  and  the  step, and  with  the  girls  be  handy.
