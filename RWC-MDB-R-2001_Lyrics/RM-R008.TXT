I've Been Workin' On the Railroad

I've  been  workin'  on  the  railroad,

All  the  live  long  day.

I've  been  workin'  on  the  railroad,

Just  to  pass  the  time  away.

  Can't  you  hear  the  whistle  blowing ?

  Rise  up  so  early  in  the  morn.

  Can  you  hear  the  captain  shouting ?

  " Dinah, blow  your  horn ! "

   ÅñDinah  won't  you  blow, Dinah  won't  you  blow,

    Dinah  won't  you  blow  your  horn.

   Åñrepeat


  Someone's  in  the  kitchen  with  Dinah.

  Someone's  in  the  kitchen, I  know.

  Someone's  in  the  kitchen  with  Dinah.

  Strumming  on  the  old  banjo.


I've  been  workin'  on  the  railroad,

All  the  live  long  day.

I've  been  workin'  on  the  railroad,

Just  to  pass  the  time  away.

  Can't  you  hear  the  whistle  blowing ?

  Rise  up  so  early  in  the  morn.

  Can  you  hear  the  captain  shouting ?

  " Dinah, blow  your  horn ! "
