Home on the Range

Oh, give  me  a  home  where  the  Buffalo  roam,

and  the  deer  and  the  antelope  play.

Where  seldom  is  heard  a  discouraging  word,

and  the  skies  are  not  cloudy  all  day.

  Home, home  on  the  range,

  Where  the  deer  and  the  antelope  play,

    Where  seldom  is  heard  a  discouraging  word,

    and  the  skies  are  not  cloudy  all  day.


Where  the  air  is  so  pure  and  the  zephyrs  so  free,

and  the  breezes  so  balmy  and  light.

Oh, I  would  not  exchange  my  home  on  the  range,

For  all  of  the  cities  so  Bright.

   Home, home  on  the  range,

  Where  the  deer  and  the  antelope  play,

    Where  seldom  is  heard  a  discouraging  word,

    and  the  skies  are  not  cloudy  all  day.
